# gh-browse

> Open relevant Github.com pages directly using a CLI

Inspired by [Paul Irish and his lazyweb-request](https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/25).

Because every README would need a 30-seconds screencast: [check this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f4k4XbZy_g&feature=youtu.be).

$ npm install -g gh-browse
```

## Todo

Pull requests are highly accepted.

- [ ] `gh-browse parent`: must open the parent (if the project is a fork)
- [ ] `gh-browse <branch>`: must open homepage in a specific branch
- [ ] `gh-browse wiki`
- [ ] `gh-browse commits HEAD^1`
- [ ] Integrate some tests. The initial project was a quick fiddle, but some basic tests might be welcome.
- [ ] Proper up code. It's needed.
